                    <p>The elementary schools use computers for testing and other activities, but it is a rare school curriculum that includes any computer programming. In the Year of Code, many schools across the world started including a computer programming skills segment to the school day. This type of education helps kids to learn the basic inner workings of computers. </p>

                    <p>Computational thinking is the ability to communicate your thoughts in a structured and logical way. This type of thought process is like the step by step instructions that are coded into a computer. It is also the process of thinking up and then solving problems in a methodical way that could be replicated by a machine. Software engineers, computer programmers, and logistics specialists use this method of thinking to solve problems.</p>

                <div class="feature-text">
                    <p>Children have creative and fluid minds that allow them to think in a more “out of the box” way. The nearly endless ways of coding and solving problems can inspire kids to grow. You can show your child that coding is a type of storytelling. There is a logical beginning, progression, and ending to the story and the program. These skills can set kids up for success in written and oral communications in school and thankfully the introduction of IT basics in primary schools is rightly becoming widespread.</p>
