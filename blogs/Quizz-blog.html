                    <p>With quizzes so popular, is there any evidence to suggest that they really are valuable in a child’s education? Well, yes – ask any teacher! In classrooms up and down the land teachers set their students tests and quizzes to help them learn. All those teachers can’t be wrong! The value of tests and quizzes is unquestionable.</p>

            <h1>Do Quizzes Help Us Retain Information?</h1>

                    <i class="fas fa-tooth"></i>

                <div class="feature-text">
                    <p>It’s a well-known fact that retrieval aids retention. Reading information as a way of learning does have its uses. But reading information and then taking a quiz is much more effective. Forcing your brain to retrieve data ensures that it becomes ‘embedded’ for use in the future. So, yes, quizzes do help us retain information.</p>

            <h1>Can Quizzes Help the Learning Process?</h1>

                    <i class="far fa-circle"></i> 
                </div>
                <div class="feature-text">
                    <p>As quizzes help to embed information in our brains, this provides a firm foundation for the next stage of learning. Take maths as an example – once something is mastered by making use of quizzes (methods of multiplication say) then this will help to support any future, more advanced learning (like algebra). Quizzes can help to prepare children for the next stage in their education and help the learning process.</p>
